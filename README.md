# to-do-list

>To see the source code go to 'main' branch. The 'gh-pages' branch is used for the deployment of the React app to github.

App created with the idea of learning React Redux and a simple authentication model with Firebase. 

The Redux state is used to manage list items, checked and unchecked items, this being done through the List Slice. Another Slice is used to manage the modal, and another one for checking log in status.

Authentication is being done through the Google Pop Up method using Firebase.


Tools I aquired during this project: 

  	-> React Redux Toolkit to create global state
		
	-> Filtering items with information from the state
	
	-> Reading from the state and modifying it  
 
  	-> Authentication with Firebase
  
  	-> Reading information from the Google user authentication
